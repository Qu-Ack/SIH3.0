last e-waste facility update in india 2021

first our target is where is larger E-waste in india not where is more population 
 India's major metropolitan cities, such as Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai, and Kolkata, have higher population densities and greater urbanization. These cities typically have a higher concentration of e-waste facilities and a larger user base for e-waste facility locators due to increased electronic device usage.

 IT Hubs: 
 Cities like Bengaluru (often referred to as the Silicon Valley of India) and Hyderabad, which are known for their IT and technology sectors, tend to have a larger use of e-waste facility locators. The tech-savvy population in these cities is more likely to engage in responsible e-waste disposal.

Urban and Industrial Regions: 
Regions with high levels of industrial and commercial activity, such as Gujarat (especially around Ahmedabad), Pune (in Maharashtra), and Noida (in Uttar Pradesh), (may*****) have a larger usage of e-waste facility locators due to the generation of electronic waste from industries and businesses.
