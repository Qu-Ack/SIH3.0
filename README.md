PSID 1417 AI-ML based intelligent de-smoking/de-hazing algorithm

steps 

1. Data Collection => A set of images that will be used to detect fires. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/phylake1337/fire-dataset)
2. Data Augmentation => This include processing the data . First cleaning the data , removing any corrupted files then rotating , resizing , adding random noise , Brightness and other stuff.
3. Data Splitting => 
Random Shuffling: Before splitting, it's a good practice to shuffle your dataset randomly. This      ensures that the data in each subset is representative of the entire dataset and prevents any bias due to ordering.

Training Set: Allocate the majority of your data to the training set, typically around 70-80% of the total dataset. The model learns from this data.Validation Set: Set aside a smaller portion, typically around 10-15%, for the validation set. This set is used to fine-tune hyperparameters and assess the model's performance during training.

Test Set: Reserve another portion, usually the same size as the validation set (10-15%), for the test set. The test set is used for final model evaluation and should not be used for model training or hyperparameter tuning.

4. Model Selection => CNN networks are used but are very complex

5. Making the model => Maa chud jayegi isko banane me "Compile the model by specifying the optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics. The choice of optimizer and loss function depends on your specific problem. For binary classification (fire vs. non-fire), you can use the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss." ye chat gpt ka answer 




PSID 1369 Online integrated platform for projects taken up by the students of various universities/colleges


1. TO build a solid landing page along with a sign up / login form
2. TO build a dashboard for the user containing his uploaded projects and a feature to upload new projects
3. we can add a feature where user can get points on the number of projects he has uploaded and other fun features like this to make our project stand out. 
4. to build a database where we will store user's information and all the projects uploaded
5. to build a search feature where user can search for projects uploaded and filter them uni wise. 


PSID 1431 Online personalized learning remediation/tutoring tool. Search for best teacher for specific topics.

1. We need to know the teachers for that we take feedback from students and that gives us the best teachers of particular topics
2. we need to know the students. we conduct tests and in that test we analyze the students performance and we pinpoint the topics that he blundered. 
3. We connect the student with the teacher of that particular topic 
4. at the end we give the student a performance report.


PSID 1367 To develop a technical solution for enabling Institution level verification of students of one State studying in other State/s, who are at present generally denied benefits under the Scholarship scheme as the Institutions in which they are studying are not registered on the portal/s of their home State.
